A server its generally located in a data center
A server can be eaither physical or virtual, the physical beeing all the hardware, and the virtual a software based representation of a physical server
All the servers runs an OS, almost always beeing linux
The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users
The application server collaborates with the web server to return a dynamic response to a user request
The data base role is to store all the data, typically managed by a database management system
The DNS role its to transform from the domain name to the IP address
This is a single point failure because it doesnt have a secondary server, if the server stops working, the entire system stops too
When new code its deployed, the website will be temporarily down because it needs to restart the web server
beeing only 1 server, it cannot expand and it'll be a point that the server will not be able to handle traffic
TCP/IP its used to interconnect network devices on the interned
